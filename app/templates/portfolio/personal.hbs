{{project-page 
  description="This current site, my personal website, is an on-going project. I originally
  built my website with Jekyll, which still hosts my blog, but wanted something
  that I could also use to show off some of my skills. This site, www.tomleskin.com,
  is built with Ember.js 2.6 and Bootstrap. It uses a couple Ember addons such as 
  Liquid Fire for transition animations and font awesome. It's hosted on Heroku."
