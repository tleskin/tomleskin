  description="IPAPI was my first Ember project. It was built on Ember 1.11. It may
  not look like much but this was a project built in about two weeks. It involves an API of 
  homebrew recipes built in Rails and then the front-end is built in Ember and has minimal styling
  with Bootstrap. It was a very much exploration project and was my first time working with a
  JavaScript framework."
